## Additional Pipeline Scripts

This repo now includes conversion scripts to support more data formats for interlinear glossing.

### Scripts Added:
- `elan_to_pipeline.py`: Converts ELAN exports to CRF-friendly format.
- `pipeline_to_elan.py`: Converts CRF results back into ELAN-readable format.
- `toolbox_to_pipeline.py`: Converts Toolbox-formatted IGT data to CRF pipeline format.

These scripts are meant to support the extended glossing needs described in the paper.
